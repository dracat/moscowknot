Among the picturesque variety of the Moscow Knot party participants, the Rigger I love most is Jaeger. He says that he started showing interest in the bondage in 2006. The development of his unique style was greatly influenced by the art of such Riggers as AlekZander and Arisue Go. After Eger attended the Kinbacon festival in Lvov in 2009, he revealed bondage as art. Starting from that time, the bondage has gone beyond small-scale sado-maso practice for him, and the ropes have become an essential part of the Rigger’s image. Since 2010, the Rigger has been performing on stage. It all started as public performances during the meetings of the Yugen club in Saint Petersburg.</br>
Also, the bondage fitted in the Rigger’s passion for artistic photography. This interaction together with public performances urges his professional growth in the “art of ropes”. Jaeger says that the bondage for him is a mix of three main components: power, emotions and trust, and this mix is achieved by means of such a seemingly simple tool as a rope. All performances of the Rigger are characterized not only by high professionalism and a unique style but also by the unique work with a model. Each number is unforgettable, which is mainly caused by the extraordinary intensity of emotions and passions. The Rigger does not play them, he lives them on stage. Other characteristics of the style of Jaeger's performances that are worth mentioning are an incredible sense of humor, courage, sincerity, desire to amaze, to frighten, to shock the audience, to knock them down. His performances combine such diametrically opposite sensations as horror and laughter, pain and tenderness, beauty and cruelty. The Rigger makes the audience empathize, not only watch remotely but feel themselves as real participants of the breathtaking performance. He erases borders between the audience and the performers. Unpredictability, beauty, eroticism and sensuality of the action can never leave anyone indifferent.</br>

						My acquaintance with bondage took place at the first bondage fest in 2007 - there I saw this practice personaly for the first time. Since that time it has always been present in my life.</br>
I didn't have any teachers, whom I am able to name, but there are some masters, whose seminars I have visited for those years that I was in bondage personaly. They are: AlekZander, WykD Dave, Riccardo Wildties and Bruce Esinem.</br>
Besides, I try to examine every new tie or type of hanging.</br>
The central thing in bondage is the interaction between a master and his model, in my opinion. There can be different results of this interaction: pain, pleasure, balancing somewhere between sensuality and sadism, orgasm - the range is wide. I can't stay only indifference. The beauty of tying and aesthetics of ropes is pleasant for me, but not a necessary consequence of such a "dialogue".</br>
My shows and actions could be seen at such large events as BDSM FISHING 2011, 2012 (Moscow), BDSM CASTLE (Moscow), RopeFest (St.Petersburg), and of course MoscowKnot, which scene I 'll visit this year with great pleasure and with a new idea.

                    <p class="perf">Georg believes that bondage is beautiful when it is full of sincerity, passion, dizzying drive. Even if the technic is perfect, bondage can still be easily ruined by fake emotions. The most essential quality of a rigger is recognizability, his own style, when we can define who is the author of the ties with a single photo. </br>
Moscow Knot for me is a festival, a big show, and all the participants become a family in these days, and it is maybe the only place to see a large number of different styles. Moscow Knot always has a welcome surprise for us with something new and outstanding.

						<p class="perf">In 2014 there was my first time I got into the world of ropes. At that moment I wished for something new, unexplored.
Suddenly I dived into such a phenomenon as bondage. I watched Akira Naka and Randa May’s videos and understood clearer that I desired to experience these emotions myself, which had the masters during their sessions. More over I was eager to learn how to give such bright emotions to my partner.
I studied tying by trial and error, gradually realizing that ropes are able to give you great power. Besides I intended to discover every knot by my mind and to feel it by my heart. 
In my opinion bondage is one of the ways to communicate with a woman. Ropes can make something that words can’t do, and you don’t always need words.
We have a proverb: there is no limit of perfection. I am sure it refers to bondage too: there are no bounds of developing, there is always something to learn.

						<p class="perf">I first learned about shibari in 2009, reading Alek Zander's article on his website. Since then I got carried away with tying. I've been learning different ties at home by looking at the pictures and reading related articles. 
I started to visit rope bondage events and workshops only in 2014.
The next year I first performed on stage, since then rope bondage, actions and stage became the huge part of my life. These three different components almost never come together. I separate them in three parts:</br>
- bondage for myself, when me and my partner are left only to ourselves, when passions and emotions are in full swing, and unity with the partner grows stronger with each turn of the rope;</br>
- bondage in a close circle, when only a part of the intimate is taken to the show, remaining a mystery to others, when power and pain, inevitability and shame prevail;</br>
- and bondage for the scene - images dominate over reality, I can give vent to my imagination, adding an emotional coloring to what is happening.

He has confronted and developed his skills at numerous workshops in Germany, Denmark and Italy.
Since 2012, he has been running numerous shibari workshops in Poland and Denmark.</br>
He performs at shows presenting his own style of shibari firmly rooted in a traditional Japanese shibari, in which one can see echoes of hojo jutsu, but also sensuality and delicacy.
Together with Slaanesh, his partner, they are the authors of the <a href="www.nawado.pl>www.nawado.pl</a> website which is a comprehensive textbook of shibari and bondage techniques.</br>

						Dirty dreaz life rituals</br>
Little swastika is doing body rituals with hooks since 15 years. His way of shibari is pretty unique as he isn’t holding to any traditional rules and he uses the rope as addition to the much stronger hook ritual suspensions. It's more like a crazy wild and intense ritual than any classical shibari show. <br>
Dirty dreaz shows are not really shows. Each time they go on stage they do a very intense ritual they can’ practice in this way before. With a combination of hooks and different techniques to cut down shibari or hook positions in a very radical way, the rite shows still a lot of gentle love and it’s kind of peaceful within itself.</p>

	Sergey ExmelinLiSiTsin and Olga Svoboda make a creative duet and a BDSM couple. Together they organize bondage erotic photoshoots, perform in clubs and give classes in Saint-Petersburg, Moscow, Minsk, Kiev. They participated in MoscowKnot festival in 2014, 2015 and 2016.</br>
«We were always glad to perform onMoscowKnot stage. We think that this event organized by Vlada and Falco is the largest one in the Eastern Europe bondage world.</br>
Our public bondage doesn’t differ a lot from our private sessions. It’s not a game, it’s always emotional and expressive. We strive to be best remembered for intensity, sexuality and the incredible tense on stage. Bondage for us is most and utmost about close contact with each other during the session, it is about interaction and opportunity to feel your partner by ropes. We like the game of desires, the feeling of might and submission. We want the intermixture of appetences of both rigger and his model to form the mutual satisfaction in classical technics».

</br>
						This incredibly creative and productive alliance was formed more than seven years ago. Vlada practices rope bondage, flagellation and a variety of BD-practices. Falco is her partner who prefers extreme bondage. Their views on bondage, as a type of torture, surprisingly coincided, giving rise to a unique style - sensual, expressive, probing the limits of human capabilities. Vlada said in an interview that bondage is a significant, very important part of their life, the process often is more interesting to me than the result. Usually goal of my action not only the tied body itself but the process of bondage, so infinite and exotic as growing bonsai.
</br>
						Since 2011, Vlad and Falco regularly participate in a variety of bondage events. Their performances were seen in several cities of Russia, as well as in Ukraine, the Czech Republic, Germany, France, Switzerland, Israel, Britain, Italy, Japan and Taiwan. Obsession of travelling connected with passion of photography. Many people have seen pictures of Falco, tied among the sights of the world capitals. Each trip of this couple is a creative act, in which not only the tied body, but also the usual objects of the city space are rethought.
