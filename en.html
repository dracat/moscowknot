						My acquaintance with bondage took place at the first bondage fest in 2007 - there I saw this practice personaly for the first time. Since that time it has always been present in my life.</br>
I didn't have any teachers, whom I am able to name, but there are some masters, whose seminars I have visited for those years that I was in bondage personaly. They are: AlekZander, WykD Dave, Riccardo Wildties and Bruce Esinem.</br>
Besides, I try to examine every new tie or type of hanging.</br>
The central thing in bondage is the interaction between a master and his model, in my opinion. There can be different results of this interaction: pain, pleasure, balancing somewhere between sensuality and sadism, orgasm - the range is wide. I can't stay only indifference. The beauty of tying and aesthetics of ropes is pleasant for me, but not a necessary consequence of such a "dialogue".</br>
My shows and actions could be seen at such large events as BDSM FISHING 2011, 2012 (Moscow), BDSM CASTLE (Moscow), RopeFest (St.Petersburg), and of course MoscowKnot, which scene I 'll visit this year with great pleasure and with a new idea.

                    <p class="perf">Georg believes that bondage is beautiful when it is full of sincerity, passion, dizzying drive. Even if the technic is perfect, bondage can still be easily ruined by fake emotions. The most essential quality of a rigger is recognizability, his own style, when we can define who is the author of the ties with a single photo. </br>
Moscow Knot for me is a festival, a big show, and all the participants become a family in these days, and it is maybe the only place to see a large number of different styles. Moscow Knot always has a welcome surprise for us with something new and outstanding.

						<p class="perf">In 2014 there was my first time I got into the world of ropes. At that moment I wished for something new, unexplored.
Suddenly I dived into such a phenomenon as bondage. I watched Akira Naka and Randa May’s videos and understood clearer that I desired to experience these emotions myself, which had the masters during their sessions. More over I was eager to learn how to give such bright emotions to my partner.
I studied tying by trial and error, gradually realizing that ropes are able to give you great power. Besides I intended to discover every knot by my mind and to feel it by my heart. 
In my opinion bondage is one of the ways to communicate with a woman. Ropes can make something that words can’t do, and you don’t always need words.
We have a proverb: there is no limit of perfection. I am sure it refers to bondage too: there are no bounds of developing, there is always something to learn.

						Dirty dreaz life rituals</br>
Little swastika is doing body rituals with hooks since 15 years. His way of shibari is pretty unique as he isn’t holding to any traditional rules and he uses the rope as addition to the much stronger hook ritual suspensions. It's more like a crazy wild and intense ritual than any classical shibari show. <br>
Dirty dreaz shows are not really shows. Each time they go on stage they do a very intense ritual they can’ practice in this way before. With a combination of hooks and different techniques to cut down shibari or hook positions in a very radical way, the rite shows still a lot of gentle love and it’s kind of peaceful within itself.</p>

I remain an interpreter, not an innovator "

</br>
Every human is born naked. We then learn to wear clothes in order to protect ourselves from walking the path of sticks and stones. With growth, you may get hurt by words and attitudes, said and done by people, you then learn to armor your hearts. 
Some may feel you need to put on more armor, and get crushed by the own weight you put on.
All I want to tell them is, "At this moment, you don't have to feel the need to put on your armour. You are ok to take it off" - that is the basis of my kinbaku and BDSM.
</br>
For those who are too strict and cannot forgive themselves for not being able to live a regular life you seek - I will give them  punishment.
For those who cannot accept their own pleasure, I will bondage them to unleash one's heart.
</br>
Your heart at peace, is my happiness.</br>

Their views on bondage, as a type of torture, surprisingly coincided, giving rise to a unique style - sensual, expressive, probing the limits of human capabilities. Vlada said in an interview that bondage is a significant, very important part of their life, the process often is more interesting to me than the result. Usually goal of my action not only the tied body itself but the process of bondage, so infinite and exotic as growing bonsai.
</br>
						Since 2011, Vlad and Falco regularly participate in a variety of bondage events. Their performances were seen in several cities of Russia, as well as in Ukraine, the Czech Republic, Germany, France, Switzerland, Israel, Britain, Italy, Japan and Taiwan. Obsession of travelling connected with passion of photography. Many people have seen pictures of Falco, tied among the sights of the world capitals. Each trip of this couple is a creative act, in which not only the tied body, but also the usual objects of the city space are rethought.

She practiced for many years Shiatsu and Aikido and these disciplines gave her some taste about the Japanese way to work with Energy.
Her first love in BDSM has been Bondage and it still is.</br>
Since she arrived in Berlin her knowledge about Bondage has improved through a constant practice first in the world of the former Schwelle7 and actually at Studio 6x6.
At the moment she does it also professionally as a Prodomme at Studio Lux in Berlin and her research is constantly moving ahead.</br>

<b>I-SHI</b></br>
I was born in Barcelona in 1983, between 2014 and 2016 I made a brief incursion in artistic
modelling. It was through the photographic project “Shibari Experience” how I met Alberto No
Shibari, who brought me the opportunity to fully explore the world of ropes and to start
collaborating in courses, talks, photo sessions and performances.</br>
By the end of 2017 I joined NoShibari Lab as a model and rigger, beggining an artistic and
learning project in constant evolution in which I walk my own way deconstructing what I’ve
learned to create new forms of teaching, communicate and tying.</br>

I do not tolerate falsity, even at the performances, it is always a full-fledged action and real emotions. My style includes minimalism, dynamics, candidness and sadism. I always try to avoid stock schemes, preferring elements invented by me and borrowed from the history of the Inquisition. 
</br>P.S. There will be no beautiful picture or languid sighs. Prepare to see the victim and the executioner. However he is in love with his victim... But still the executioner.</p>

                       <p class="perf">My first experience with ropes was in 2009, when I was tied up by an experienced rigger. After a couple of years I started tying, too. At first it was my curiosity and a desire to let others feel what I felt, but soon I couldn’t imagine myself in any other role. Since I’m a creative person, I couldn’t pass up an opportunity to fulfill my ideas, so in 2012 I was already performing on stage. There’s of course a huge difference between doing bondage on stage and in private, each of these has its unique perks, and each is really valuable to me. 
</br>‘For me there’s nothing more precious than emotions. Rope is a method. From soft touches to intense torture. During a scene I give away everything I have. From pain to tenderness’.</p>

Its threads are communication, caring, family, understanding of life, personal philosophy, it’s what the couple is made of and each person is made of. 
</br>
When we take ropes, it’s the connection we take, we bind not with ropes, but with our thoughts, we ourselves are a turbulent stream of thought and emotion. By striking out particular feelings we put them into our partner, and if the partner accepts them, the rope becomes ‘heavy’, it squeezes the couple, making them closer and more honest to each other, this is how I see it.

Karlson & Malysh are a BDSM couple formed 6 years ago. ‘I got into bodage thanks to Mikhail Balabanchik. What I care most in bondage is its functionality, in the first place, and also connecting with the partner. I like to experiment and seek new sensations. Bondage is lack of freedom for one partner and power over him for the other partner. Power to give pain and pleasure. Rope is a symbol of the said power, rope is a multipurpose tool: it can caress, bring a feeling of calm and safety, and the very next moment it can rip and torture. Rope is a conductor of emotion, and emotion is one of the main purposes of a session, both a private one, and a stage performance.’

                        <p class="perf">
Shiatsu and Shibari are both disciplines born in Japan.
They have in common, according to my experience, some traits and they can be complementary for others.
</br>
When I first met the world of ropes I was already a Shiatsu therapist since several years, and concepts like vital energy, meridians, pressure resonated familiar in my mind and at that point I was looking for their expressive dimension, which in my opinion should have been not only strictly related to sickness and problems to face.
You can’t do Shiatsu with ropes, that’s impossible, but through Shiatsu you can make experience of what means receiving  and giving pressure, which parts of the body may have a correspondence and a resonance with some emotions and states of mind and how to work with it. 
</br>
In this workshop we will explore what are the common points between the world of ropes, the restrictions and the pressure and pressure points, we will work with the breath and try to go beyond the surface of our body.
No previous experience is necessary, if possible bring your own ropes.

<b>Quick release structures:</b></br>
Untying can be a very interesting part of a shibari session, yet sometimes, when the model is in an inverted suspension and you want to remove the chest harness, or when you want to create a sensation of contrast between restriction and freedom, or even in a situation of potential harm, when it is important  to untie very fast, in all those situations  being able to create a safe route with a few movements is allways a very good resource, plus it is very spectacular on the stage. In this workshop we will learn quick-release versions of classical ties like TK, hishi, futomomo,…

<b>Movement and sensations </b></br>
Shibari is pure intensity, it is about emotion, about taking who is being tied to places they cannot reach on their own. Shibari is to take control of the shapes, the rythm, to peer inside the mind and desires of the other and to enter their very own interesting spaces. In this workshop we will reveal how to combine a bunch of techniques and methods in order to create a dynamic story within your rope sessions.

This workshop involves all the theoretical information and knowledge for the use of basic hook suspensions.It also involves a few aspects of how to involve a hook suspension into shibari and bdsm. it will provide all information about the technical point and the equipment. everyone will get a list where to get the technical equipment and the medical equipment to be able to try out suspension by himself after.
</br>
it is good when you have already some knowledge in shibari or needle play but there is no need for this. i go step by step to the full process of a hook suspension performance. and after i explain and talk about improvements and some  positions: good , painful and more easy. The right rigging and so on. This is a basic workshop where gives a idea of how its done and give the knowledge of hanging someone in a easy position in a safe way. I will hand out papers with a connection where they you can buy hooks and needles and what else you all need.
</br>
Let’s have fun and exchange after. And may be we will meet after to try out. would be nice.
</br>
