Among the picturesque variety of the Moscow Knot party participants, the Rigger I love most is Jaeger. He says that he started showing interest in the bondage in 2006. The development of his unique style was greatly influenced by the art of such Riggers as AlekZander and Arisue Go. After Eger attended the Kinbacon festival in Lvov in 2009, he revealed bondage as art. Starting from that time, the bondage has gone beyond small-scale sado-maso practice for him, and the ropes have become an essential part of the Rigger’s image. Since 2010, the Rigger has been performing on stage. It all started as public performances during the meetings of the Yugen club in Saint Petersburg.</br>
Also, the bondage fitted in the Rigger’s passion for artistic photography. This interaction together with public performances urges his professional growth in the “art of ropes”. Jaeger says that the bondage for him is a mix of three main components: power, emotions and trust, and this mix is achieved by means of such a seemingly simple tool as a rope. All performances of the Rigger are characterized not only by high professionalism and a unique style but also by the unique work with a model. Each number is unforgettable, which is mainly caused by the extraordinary intensity of emotions and passions. The Rigger does not play them, he lives them on stage. Other characteristics of the style of Jaeger's performances that are worth mentioning are an incredible sense of humor, courage, sincerity, desire to amaze, to frighten, to shock the audience, to knock them down. His performances combine such diametrically opposite sensations as horror and laughter, pain and tenderness, beauty and cruelty. The Rigger makes the audience empathize, not only watch remotely but feel themselves as real participants of the breathtaking performance. He erases borders between the audience and the performers. Unpredictability, beauty, eroticism and sensuality of the action can never leave anyone indifferent.</br>

						My acquaintance with bondage took place at the first bondage fest in 2007 - there I saw this practice personaly for the first time. Since that time it has always been present in my life.</br>
I didn't have any teachers, whom I am able to name, but there are some masters, whose seminars I have visited for those years that I was in bondage personaly. They are: AlekZander, WykD Dave, Riccardo Wildties and Bruce Esinem.</br>
Besides, I try to examine every new tie or type of hanging.</br>
The central thing in bondage is the interaction between a master and his model, in my opinion. There can be different results of this interaction: pain, pleasure, balancing somewhere between sensuality and sadism, orgasm - the range is wide. I can't stay only indifference. The beauty of tying and aesthetics of ropes is pleasant for me, but not a necessary consequence of such a "dialogue".</br>
My shows and actions could be seen at such large events as BDSM FISHING 2011, 2012 (Moscow), BDSM CASTLE (Moscow), RopeFest (St.Petersburg), and of course MoscowKnot, which scene I 'll visit this year with great pleasure and with a new idea.

						<b>PILAR ALDEA</b></br>
Pilar Aldea study  Lighting and Images in the  High School of Communication, Image and Sound of Madrid. She directed Consulta Films Bruselas/Madrid, producing and specializing in experimental cinema between 1995 and 2009.
In Formentera in 2011 she founded Producciones Como Mola, whose 12th production is currently under development.</br>
Since 2015, Aldea is a member of the Espai F Collective: a cross-cultural association dedicated to stage arts and cultural revitalization in Formentera.</br>
 
Aldea discovered rope bondage in 2010, and a passion was ignited that remains to this day. She studied classic Shibari with, among others, Haruki Yukimura, Akira Naka, Yukinaga Max, Osada Steve and Alberto Noshibari and has continued in her practice by taking classes with Dasniya Sommer, Shadow, Felix Ruckert, Bergborg and Sangs Blague, Nawashi Murakawa, Vlada and Falco.
 </br>
Her work has evolved into a personal quest to find and set alight the obscurities of human sensuality, both for the individual and the collective. 
Taking an ethical, sensual, creative and free-style approach to rope, she makes place in her work for both the dramatic and the humorous.
</br>
</br>
Between 2012 and 2015, together with Ana Gutiérrez, she developed the project "Cuerdas Poéticas, Sensual Performance of Explicit Poetry" with performances and workshops among othersin :</br>

                    <p class="perf">Georg believes that bondage is beautiful when it is full of sincerity, passion, dizzying drive. Even if the technic is perfect, bondage can still be easily ruined by fake emotions. The most essential quality of a rigger is recognizability, his own style, when we can define who is the author of the ties with a single photo. </br>
Moscow Knot for me is a festival, a big show, and all the participants become a family in these days, and it is maybe the only place to see a large number of different styles. Moscow Knot always has a welcome surprise for us with something new and outstanding.

						<p class="perf">In 2014 there was my first time I got into the world of ropes. At that moment I wished for something new, unexplored.
Suddenly I dived into such a phenomenon as bondage. I watched Akira Naka and Randa May’s videos and understood clearer that I desired to experience these emotions myself, which had the masters during their sessions. More over I was eager to learn how to give such bright emotions to my partner.
I studied tying by trial and error, gradually realizing that ropes are able to give you great power. Besides I intended to discover every knot by my mind and to feel it by my heart. 
In my opinion bondage is one of the ways to communicate with a woman. Ropes can make something that words can’t do, and you don’t always need words.
We have a proverb: there is no limit of perfection. I am sure it refers to bondage too: there are no bounds of developing, there is always something to learn.

						Dirty dreaz life rituals</br>
Little swastika is doing body rituals with hooks since 15 years. His way of shibari is pretty unique as he isn’t holding to any traditional rules and he uses the rope as addition to the much stronger hook ritual suspensions. It's more like a crazy wild and intense ritual than any classical shibari show. <br>
Dirty dreaz shows are not really shows. Each time they go on stage they do a very intense ritual they can’ practice in this way before. With a combination of hooks and different techniques to cut down shibari or hook positions in a very radical way, the rite shows still a lot of gentle love and it’s kind of peaceful within itself.</p>

Kinbaku is the school of humility,
   "Every model, every emotion, every moment are different,
I remain an interpreter, not an innovator "

"I received great influences from Japanese kinbakushis
 I thank them every day for their generosity, quality of their teaching,

Every human is born naked. We then learn to wear clothes in order to protect ourselves from walking the path of sticks and stones. With growth, you may get hurt by words and attitudes, said and done by people, you then learn to armor your hearts. 
Some may feel you need to put on more armor, and get crushed by the own weight you put on.
All I want to tell them is, "At this moment, you don't have to feel the need to put on your armour. You are ok to take it off" - that is the basis of my kinbaku and BDSM.
</br>
For those who are too strict and cannot forgive themselves for not being able to live a regular life you seek - I will give them  punishment.
For those who cannot accept their own pleasure, I will bondage them to unleash one's heart.

Your heart at peace, is my happiness.</br>

Our public bondage doesn’t differ a lot from our private sessions. It’s not a game, it’s always emotional and expressive. We strive to be best remembered for intensity, sexuality and the incredible tense on stage. Bondage for us is most and utmost about close contact with each other during the session, it is about interaction and opportunity to feel your partner by ropes. We like the game of desires, the feeling of might and submission. We want the intermixture of appetences of both rigger and his model to form the mutual satisfaction in classical technics».

						This incredibly creative and productive alliance was formed more than seven years ago. Vlada practices rope bondage, flagellation and a variety of BD-practices. Falco is her partner who prefers extreme bondage. Their views on bondage, as a type of torture, surprisingly coincided, giving rise to a unique style - sensual, expressive, probing the limits of human capabilities. Vlada said in an interview that bondage is a significant, very important part of their life, the process often is more interesting to me than the result. Usually goal of my action not only the tied body itself but the process of bondage, so infinite and exotic as growing bonsai.
</br>
						Since 2011, Vlad and Falco regularly participate in a variety of bondage events. Their performances were seen in several cities of Russia, as well as in Ukraine, the Czech Republic, Germany, France, Switzerland, Israel, Britain, Italy, Japan and Taiwan. Obsession of travelling connected with passion of photography. Many people have seen pictures of Falco, tied among the sights of the world capitals. Each trip of this couple is a creative act, in which not only the tied body, but also the usual objects of the city space are rethought.

<b>I-SHI</b></br>
I was born in Barcelona in 1983, between 2014 and 2016 I made a brief incursion in artistic
modelling. It was through the photographic project “Shibari Experience” how I met Alberto No
Shibari, who brought me the opportunity to fully explore the world of ropes and to start
collaborating in courses, talks, photo sessions and performances.</br>
By the end of 2017 I joined NoShibari Lab as a model and rigger, beggining an artistic and
learning project in constant evolution in which I walk my own way deconstructing what I’ve
learned to create new forms of teaching, communicate and tying.</br>

Первый раз столкнулась с верёвками в 2009 году, сразу  оказавшись в руках у опытного бондажиста. Спустя пару лет начала связывать сама. Сначала меня вело любопытство и желание подарить те эмоции что испытывала,  но вскоре я уже не представляла себя в другой роли.  Будучи  творческой личностью, конечно, не смогла упустить возможность реализовать свои идеи, и уже в 2012 году оказалась на сцене. Безусловно существует огромная  разница между  бондажом  на сцене и в привате, в каждом из них есть свои уникальные особенности,  каждый из них невероятно ценен для меня.

                        <p class="perf">
Shiatsu and Shibari are both disciplines born in Japan.
They have in common, according to my experience, some traits and they can be complementary for others.
</br>
When I first met the world of ropes I was already a Shiatsu therapist since several years, and concepts like vital energy, meridians, pressure resonated familiar in my mind and at that point I was looking for their expressive dimension, which in my opinion should have been not only strictly related to sickness and problems to face.
You can’t do Shiatsu with ropes, that’s impossible, but through Shiatsu you can make experience of what means receiving  and giving pressure, which parts of the body may have a correspondence and a resonance with some emotions and states of mind and how to work with it. 
</br>
In this workshop we will explore what are the common points between the world of ropes, the restrictions and the pressure and pressure points, we will work with the breath and try to go beyond the surface of our body.
No previous experience is necessary, if possible bring your own ropes.

<b>Quick release structures:</b></br>
Untying can be a very interesting part of a shibari session, yet sometimes, when the model is in an inverted suspension and you want to remove the chest harness, or when you want to create a sensation of contrast between restriction and freedom, or even in a situation of potential harm, when it is important  to untie very fast, in all those situations  being able to create a safe route with a few movements is allways a very good resource, plus it is very spectacular on the stage. In this workshop we will learn quick-release versions of classical ties like TK, hishi, futomomo,…

<b>Movement and sensations </b></br>
Shibari is pure intensity, it is about emotion, about taking who is being tied to places they cannot reach on their own. Shibari is to take control of the shapes, the rythm, to peer inside the mind and desires of the other and to enter their very own interesting spaces. In this workshop we will reveal how to combine a bunch of techniques and methods in order to create a dynamic story within your rope sessions.
