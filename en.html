Among the picturesque variety of the Moscow Knot party participants, the Rigger I love most is Jaeger. He says that he started showing interest in the bondage in 2006. The development of his unique style was greatly influenced by the art of such Riggers as AlekZander and Arisue Go. After Eger attended the Kinbacon festival in Lvov in 2009, he revealed bondage as art. Starting from that time, the bondage has gone beyond small-scale sado-maso practice for him, and the ropes have become an essential part of the Rigger’s image. Since 2010, the Rigger has been performing on stage. It all started as public performances during the meetings of the Yugen club in Saint Petersburg.</br>
Also, the bondage fitted in the Rigger’s passion for artistic photography. This interaction together with public performances urges his professional growth in the “art of ropes”. Jaeger says that the bondage for him is a mix of three main components: power, emotions and trust, and this mix is achieved by means of such a seemingly simple tool as a rope. All performances of the Rigger are characterized not only by high professionalism and a unique style but also by the unique work with a model. Each number is unforgettable, which is mainly caused by the extraordinary intensity of emotions and passions. The Rigger does not play them, he lives them on stage. Other characteristics of the style of Jaeger's performances that are worth mentioning are an incredible sense of humor, courage, sincerity, desire to amaze, to frighten, to shock the audience, to knock them down. His performances combine such diametrically opposite sensations as horror and laughter, pain and tenderness, beauty and cruelty. The Rigger makes the audience empathize, not only watch remotely but feel themselves as real participants of the breathtaking performance. He erases borders between the audience and the performers. Unpredictability, beauty, eroticism and sensuality of the action can never leave anyone indifferent.</br>

						<p class="perf">Vital is a computer engineer, a master in metaphysics, and martial arts lover. He also studied traditional photography since he was young; he incorporates new tendencies, but carefully making sure of not compromising his own style. By revealing experiences without any modification, he provides an inside look of sexual taboos, and what happens when the we left aside inhibitions in order to allow our beings to feel, explore and interact sexuality and eroticism in a unique experience. He is always searching to create his own art without leaving sensuality, expressions, and energy that creates an affinity among the people involved.</br>
The exclusive club Quaternary is an artistic project that involves his biggest passions Photography and Metaphysics. MitZuky has been at his side for more than three years organizing themed event and activities that promotes BDSM, Fetishism, FemDom, Kinkiness, Swingers, S&M, Naturism and the Japan rope art among others. We do public Shibari shows, SM&SW as well as FemDom private session, and Kinbaku private shows. Quaternary is an exclusive club where multiple life styles can be enjoyed with cordiality, respect and discretion </br>
VitAl&Mit </br>
Kinbaku is an essential part of our lives, A total new meaning can be perceived when the submissive give away his will to the artist, at the same time that is using his ropes to elevate them to a deeper state in sensuality, pleasure, feelings and emotions. There are no words to explain how in silence time stops and just a minimal sound is needed to start an energy interchange, an internal trance, a spiritual experience. No script, nothing planned, it is just a spontaneous moment where the strong connection sings the participant souls in a mutual satisfaction.

						My acquaintance with bondage took place at the first bondage fest in 2007 - there I saw this practice personaly for the first time. Since that time it has always been present in my life.</br>
I didn't have any teachers, whom I am able to name, but there are some masters, whose seminars I have visited for those years that I was in bondage personaly. They are: AlekZander, WykD Dave, Riccardo Wildties and Bruce Esinem.</br>
Besides, I try to examine every new tie or type of hanging.</br>
The central thing in bondage is the interaction between a master and his model, in my opinion. There can be different results of this interaction: pain, pleasure, balancing somewhere between sensuality and sadism, orgasm - the range is wide. I can't stay only indifference. The beauty of tying and aesthetics of ropes is pleasant for me, but not a necessary consequence of such a "dialogue".</br>
My shows and actions could be seen at such large events as BDSM FISHING 2011, 2012 (Moscow), BDSM CASTLE (Moscow), RopeFest (St.Petersburg), and of course MoscowKnot, which scene I 'll visit this year with great pleasure and with a new idea.

Justin Rvt likes to wonder. 
</br>
Is it possible? If yes, how? Otherwise, why?
</br>
Since 2014, he works on a regular basis with these questions in mind. Thinking out the box with a solid technical background is part of his process. 
</br>
This method leads to intense ties and powerful scenes where the ropes are used to make his partner look more beautiful trough complex shapes and suffering. 
</br>
Gwen Sh discovered Shibari last year with Justin. 
</br>
Within the strong influence of Gorgone she started to work on body awareness and active modeling which improves drastically her physical and psychological performances. 
</br>
Both of them like to push their boundaries and make things challenging while keeping this particular energy they grew as a couple.

						<p  class="perf">Krash is a follower, first of all, of Russian bondage masters. Thanks to them and in search of inspiration, he began to form his own style. In it the rope work is always supplemented by various facilities, as well as close interaction with the partner through the grips, kicks and other delights of hard contact, various devices. 
With Lorilynn they form a pair, combining the warmth of youth and the experience of prolonged interaction with each other, which allows them to immerse themselves in experiments and use non-standard scenarios. They used to make ropesessions in the chamberlike setting, so that's why they consider the performance at Moscow Knot as a new unique experience. 
"My bondage is not static art, not an installation for photography. It's a close interaction, dynamics, pain and passion. When I bound a woman, I want to see her transformation from the crown of evolution to a naked creature, sincerely wishing to survive. I like to observe the crystallization of basic needs, the oblivion of the masks imposed during life. The rope is one of the most effective tools for this change. "

						<p class="perf">I've been obsessed with shibari right after my first lesson in March 2016. Practicing shibari gives me absolutely unbelievable emotions. When I stand under a bondage ring, holding a rope in my hand, when I approach my rope-bunny - the whole world stills in a trance state. During the tying my model becomes my dearest woman, I feel so much passion I wanna torture her, dominate her, take everything she's got. And then I give it back and give even more, warm her and cuddle her with all the tenderness.
</br>
I try to make each performance unique - in emotions, images and technique. I don't wanna be repetitive and it means a lot to me. Agression, dynamic, sex - these are ingridients for my shows and my style of tying. Each time combined in different proportions they allow me to show everything and even more.

Even if the technic is perfect, bondage can still be easily ruined by fake emotions. The most essential quality of a rigger is recognizability, his own style, when we can define who is the author of the ties with a single photo. </br>
Moscow Knot for me is a festival, a big show, and all the participants become a family in these days, and it is maybe the only place to see a large number of different styles. Moscow Knot always has a welcome surprise for us with something new and outstanding.

						<p class="perf">In 2014 there was my first time I got into the world of ropes. At that moment I wished for something new, unexplored.
Suddenly I dived into such a phenomenon as bondage. I watched Akira Naka and Randa May’s videos and understood clearer that I desired to experience these emotions myself, which had the masters during their sessions. More over I was eager to learn how to give such bright emotions to my partner.
I studied tying by trial and error, gradually realizing that ropes are able to give you great power. Besides I intended to discover every knot by my mind and to feel it by my heart. 
In my opinion bondage is one of the ways to communicate with a woman. Ropes can make something that words can’t do, and you don’t always need words.
We have a proverb: there is no limit of perfection. I am sure it refers to bondage too: there are no bounds of developing, there is always something to learn.

						<p class="perf">I first learned about shibari in 2009, reading Alek Zander's article on his website. Since then I got carried away with tying. I've been learning different ties at home by looking at the pictures and reading related articles. 
I started to visit rope bondage events and workshops only in 2014.
The next year I first performed on stage, since then rope bondage, actions and stage became the huge part of my life. These three different components almost never come together. I separate them in three parts:</br>
- bondage for myself, when me and my partner are left only to ourselves, when passions and emotions are in full swing, and unity with the partner grows stronger with each turn of the rope;</br>
- bondage in a close circle, when only a part of the intimate is taken to the show, remaining a mystery to others, when power and pain, inevitability and shame prevail;</br>
- and bondage for the scene - images dominate over reality, I can give vent to my imagination, adding an emotional coloring to what is happening.

						<p class="perf">Docvale is a French rigger who got interrested in ropes from the BDSM world since 2007. In 2011 he met Tyka and they started ropes together influenced by Kinoko Hajime and Wildties styles. 
In 2012, he became friend will Wildties and around one year later, they started to work together very regularly in Paris. At the same time, Tyka and him began to be call for workshops and performences in Europe. 
</br>
The psychological aspect of ropes became increasingly important in the way he tied and it is at this precise moment that he discovered Akira Naka’s semenawa. This intense and psychological style of bondage highlighted Docvale’s own BDSM’s expectations and confirmed his dedication to it. He became one of the very first riggers to tie in this style.
</br>
In the continuation of their first meeting with Akira Naka in Rome in July 2015, Tyka and Docvale made a trip to Japan in March 2016 in order to meet with the style's sensei. The purpose of the trip is to compare their work with the opinion of the latter. 
Since then and on recommendation of Naka Akira and Wildties, he began to work on his own style. After one year and a half trying to understand which way to follow , Docvale finally started to realise in May 2017 what his own kinbaku was. Since this moment began a new way in which you must certainly perceive old school influences.

She learned how to tie from many excellent riggers (including Gorgone, Riccardo Wildties, Yoroi Nicolas and many others) and likes to combine traditional shibari techniques with nonorthodox ways of tying. When she ties she often challenges her models with difficult ties and mixes beauty of human body with expressions of pain. Edna focuses on honest emotions shared with her partner, on mutual trust and respect and she likes to use rope as a tool of intimate communication. The audience can see that she and her partner are sharing very deep emotions when they tie on stage. Edna performs and teach at international shibari events around Europe.

						Karol – I became interested in bondage in 2011. I have learnt much by watching others do it and by feeling the bondage on my own body.Starting from 2012 I have begun to attend seminars and masterclasses by various European (La quarta corda, GeorgBarkas,Maestro BD, Nawasabi, Andrea Ropes, Yoroi Nicolas, Riccardo Wildties....) and Japanese bondage masters (NakaAkira, Kinoko, Kazami Ranki, Bingo Shigonava, Otonawa, Randa Mai ...). I have performed at the international bondage festival on stage at Boundcon (Munich), RopeFest (St. Petersburg), MoscowKnot (Moscow).
						</br>
I mostly work with women, because I can feel them like myself. A man is like a closed alien world for me. My style is to tie in close contact and in a very sensual way. I like when my partner attains pleasure through pain. Renata and I have met in summer of 2016, and our interaction has created a bond between our souls and has not left those around us indifferent to it. For me Renata is like a surge of a huge roaring river with turbulent and daring rifts andpeaceful and quiet pools.I never stop wanting to have this girl in my ropes. Our souls are tied, and we sound in unison when there is a rope between us. 
</br>
Renata – shibari is sex for me. This has always been so. I love pain, it arouses me, but with each master it is different. When I have met Karol, I saw yet another side of this magical practice. With her I have learnt that ropes can be something like magic, meditation, sex. She touched my hand, and I felt as if on fire. This is how the connection began. Her energy flowed like honey through my whole body…

Our public bondage doesn’t differ a lot from our private sessions. It’s not a game, it’s always emotional and expressive. We strive to be best remembered for intensity, sexuality and the incredible tense on stage. Bondage for us is most and utmost about close contact with each other during the session, it is about interaction and opportunity to feel your partner by ropes. We like the game of desires, the feeling of might and submission. We want the intermixture of appetences of both rigger and his model to form the mutual satisfaction in classical technics».

Bio of the model 
 </br>
Spring is an enthusiastic Dutch rope bunny and part time fetish and nude model, who loves intensity in every possible way. 
</br>
Already at a young age Spring had kinky and BDSM fantasies that she didn’t explore until 2011. Rope fascinated her from the beginning and after her first experience she was hooked. She started experimenting with rope and BDSM in her private life and gradually moved towards experimenting and modeling in front of the the camera, satisfying her exhibisionistic streak. She considers modeling on stage as an exciting next step. 
</br>

As a rope bunny, Spring loves being seriously challenged. She experiences (slow) suffering as a sexy and sensual way to a deeper connection in which she can totally surrender. Apart from the physical interaction, she loves the impact of nonverbal communication.

						This incredibly creative and productive alliance was formed more than seven years ago. Vlada practices rope bondage, flagellation and a variety of BD-practices. Falco is her partner who prefers extreme bondage. Their views on bondage, as a type of torture, surprisingly coincided, giving rise to a unique style - sensual, expressive, probing the limits of human capabilities. Vlada said in an interview that bondage is a significant, very important part of their life, the process often is more interesting to me than the result. Usually goal of my action not only the tied body itself but the process of bondage, so infinite and exotic as growing bonsai.

						Since 2011, Vlad and Falco regularly participate in a variety of bondage events. Their performances were seen in several cities of Russia, as well as in Ukraine, the Czech Republic, Germany, France, Switzerland, Israel, Britain, Italy, Japan and Taiwan. Obsession of travelling connected with passion of photography. Many people have seen pictures of Falco, tied among the sights of the world capitals. Each trip of this couple is a creative act, in which not only the tied body, but also the usual objects of the city space are rethought.

Дукивэль практикует стиль, в котором присутствует грудная обвязка практически во всех сессиях. Отходя от привычных методик, мы будем изучать некоторые типы подвесов (или частичных подвесов), избегая грудной обвязки. Мы можем вообразить, что данный способ легче или безопаснее, чем при использовании грудной обвязки. Однако, на семинаре мы сможем убедиться, насколько этот вид бондажа может быть болезненным и вызывающим стресс. Необходимые условия: опытное владение базовыми техниками кинбаку (узлы, закрепление, ослабление обвязки, техники сингл колам тай и дабл колам тай) и уверенное владение техникой подвесов.</br> Данный семинар не предназначен для новичков.</br>  При себе иметь: минимум 8-10 единиц джутовой веревки, диаметром 5-6 мм, длинной 7-8 метров.</p>

During each masterclass there will be a focus on speed of tying, the hishi (diamond shape) pattern and on providing an in-depth understanding of why we are doing things in a particular way, with detailed information for the rigger and the bunny.
</br>

First we tackle a two rope gote, explain the different styles, their pros and cons. Talk about the third rope, aesthetics, placement and more and then add two RopeMarks three-rope-pattern gotes to your rope-toolbox; more if time permits.

</br>
Second we will us an utusubuse zuri to talk suspension, suspension safety, the different nawa zuri attachments and more. We will transition the utsubuse zuri into a sakasa zuri and use this position to go into tying with a suspended partner. Before this suspension masterclass we might take a moment and explore a hishi-futomomo that can be used during the tying of a suspended partner.
</br>

Finally we will end the day with armbinders and strappado play. After this masterclass you, as a rigger, will be able to put any rope-bunny in an armbinder and play with a strappado, no matter the bunny's body type and/or flexibility.
</br>

Class type: masterclass, duration: 4h

We use ropes.
We fx our partner.
We create beautiful captivations.
We tie up our partner…
However, is this really everything
what bondage puts out? – NO!
Freely after the motto “less is
more” will we start with this
workshop, to get deeper in
the connection between the
partners.</br>
It is not about how fast you can
do a TK, It is not about how neat
your jewellerybondage is. It is
about communication, erotic,
trust and psychology! Since,
bondage CAN be more intimate
than sexual intercourse.In practical exercises will we
take a look in how we… -
take contact to our partners
and explore their bodies- , -
create emotional and mental
connections- , use the bodies
and movement to experience
an unforgettable time.</br>
Further we will give you
practical tips and tricks for
smoothly tying, rope-handling
and well-being in ropes.
The workshop is laid out on
four hours.

He will teach how fit to other's taste and develop more sensations. How do you want your SM play? Black, fluffy, foamy, strong, bitter, sweet, creamy, extra hot? Let's all talk about it! 

He says also, instead of doing "kinbaku" he is doing "Sekibaku". 

This workshop is ALL LEVEL and for everyone willing to have a journey to play with our own edges, exploring our eros and our identity, discovering very surprising 'seme' and techniques you can do with and without ropes! Our untimate intention : to give you more spices to add to your play session and for your favorite intimate moments.
